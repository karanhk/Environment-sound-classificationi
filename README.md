# About

This is script to classify environmental recording using convolutional neural network (CNN). It creates spectogram from audio file and classifies that spectrogram into 50 categories. The model is trained on [esc50]("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mmoreaux/environmental-sound-classification-50") dataset and completly implemented in python. 

# Prerequisites

`Python>=3.6`

# Getting started

1. Download the repository and unzip it.
2. Read the `instructions.txt` for better understanding of repository.
2. Install necessary packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. To test model on custom audio recording run `custom.ipynb` file.
4. To implement the model run the `main.ipynb` file.
